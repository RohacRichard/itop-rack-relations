# iTop adding rack to relations
This is a very simple iTop extension, that creates a relation between Functional CIs/Enclosures and Racks.

The relation is missing by design, it was discussed in merge request [here](https://github.com/Combodo/iTop/pull/254).

If you want to use this extension, feel free to download it and install through /extensions folder, as any other extension.
